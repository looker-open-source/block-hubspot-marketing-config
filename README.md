# Hubspot Marketing

This block is based on the [Hubspot Marketing Schema](https://fivetran.com/docs/applications/hubspot#hubspotmarketingschema) provided by [Fivetran's ETL](https://fivetran.com/docs/applications/hubspot/setup-guide).

### What does this Block do for me?

#### (1) Replicate Existing Hubspot Email Marketing Reports
- Easily replicate your existing Hubspot Email Marketing reports to gain a comprehensive view of your customers and their purchase patterns.

#### (2) Enterprise Data Platform**
- Take advantage of Looker's data platform functionality, including data actions, scheduling, permissions, alerting, and more.

#### (3) Usable / Shareable Dashboards**
- This block comes with three built-in dashboards:
  - "Hubspot Overview" - Get a high-level view of your overall email marketing efforts.
  - "Campaign Lookup" - Examine individual campaign performance metrics, and compare against benchmarks from all campaigns.
  - "Subscriptions Overview" - See subscription and spam report activity over time, identify which campaigns are subscribed to or unsibscribed from the most.

- Create your own centralized dashboards for the entire team, and departmental or individual dashboards for each user, and rest easy knowing everyone is looking at the same information at all times. Then schedule the dashboard for emails or alerts, period-end reporting, anamoly detection, or whatever else serves your use-case.
